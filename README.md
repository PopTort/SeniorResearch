# SeniorResearch
*Designed and Developed by Anthony for Senior Research (CSC450) at ECSU*

### Main Objective:
The main objective of this project is to test the overall accuracy of **AI generated functions against prewritten test cases**. With every passing year, comes newer and more advanced artifical intelligent models, some even claiming their expertice in coding ability. This project will have predetermined prompts that will be inputed into a select few of publicly available AI Chatbots..

# Test Case Guides and Information

### Test Case 1:
Case Name: Reading a File
Goal: To read the first few lines of a file location in the same folder

**Expected Results:**
This is a test file created by Tortoise
It has a few things written inside of it
...
I could really go forever with this
Okay this is the end


### Test Case 2:
Case Name: Tri-Angle Calculator
Goal: Given 2 Angles, be able to calculate the third one of any triangle

**Expected Results (Given: 60, 60):**
Angel 3 = 60


### Test Case 3:
Case Name: Alpabetical Order
Goal: Sort a list of english words into alpahbetical order

**Expected Results (Given: tree, apple, dog, cat):**
apple, cat, dog, tree


### Test Case 4: 
Case Name: Array Sorting
Goal: Sort an array of integers from lowest to highest

**Expected Results (Given: 10, 4, 6, 2):**
2, 4, 6, 10


### Test Case 5:
Case Name: Printing Counter
Goal: Print the output as a counter counts down from a set total till 0

**Expect Results (Given: 5 countBy, 100 total):**
100
95
90
...
5
0

# Prompt Related Information
### There are 5 prompts 1 for each test case
The prompts were carefully crafted in order to mention all the key information that would be required to write the code. The goal with each one of the prompts below was to require the least intervention as possible. Any invervention or complications will be noted inside of the **Results** section of this page

## Prompt 1:
**You will write a function in Java that takes a File as an input and prints off every line that is inside of that file**

## Prompt 2:
**You will write a function in Java that takes 2 integers that you assume are measurements of 2 angles of the same triangle. You will then print out the measurement of the third unknown angle**

## Prompt 3:
**You will write a function in Java that takes and automatically sorts an Array of unsorted english words.**

## Prompt 4:
**You will write a function in Java that takes automatically sorts an Array of unordered integers from least to greatest**

## Prompt 5:
**You will write a function in Java that will count down from a specific total at a specific rate and print out every integer the counter lands on. The function will take a 'countBy' and 'total' input**
